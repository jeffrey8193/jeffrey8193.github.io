## TypeScript First Impressions

This was my first interaction with both JavaScript and TypeScript, but I think I was able to quite comfortably get used to both of them. In large part, I think this is due to how similar they can be to other languages, especially TypeScript and its inclusion of variable types, and function return types. Much of TypeScript syntax like conditionals and loops are similar to Java so I was quick to pick up on proper syntax in TypeScript. Something that I think is interesting about TypeScript is that it feels less clunky while maintaining functionality. For example the image compares a function/method written in C, Java, Python, and TypeScript. In C and Java, main functions are also required to tell the code where to start while in Python and TypeScript that isn't necessary. The conditional, switch statements, and loop syntaxes in TypeScript are most similar to C and Java. This can make learning TypeScript easier if you have a background in similar languages. But TypeScript also has function definitions similar to Python where you don't need to specify return types or parameter types. TypeScript also has additional features such as  implementing arrow functions directly in your code to run calculations. TypeScript and Python also have quality of life features such as using newline to end statements. I think TypeScript is great for software development because it allows for object-oriented programming like Java and C++. It also feels more robust than languages like Python because it adds types to JavaScript. All in all, TypeScript feels like a strong choice for use in software development.

## Athletic Software Development

Having to write code while being timed was quite stressful especially since this was my first time coding in TypeScript. After the initial hurdle of getting used to writing TypeScript, I was able to approach the Workout of the Days(WODs) more logically and calmly. I think that this athletic software programming format is a good way to see what your weaknesses are. Having to correct erroneous logic in a time crunch really highlights the mistakes and shortcomings you make. I also got quite a lot from reflecting on my code and what improvements could be made as well as comparing what I wrote to the professor's solution. Being able to write clean, robust, and readable code from the get-go is an important skill to develop and I think the WODs will be able to help me develop this skill.
