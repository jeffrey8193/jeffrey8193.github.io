Belonging is a top down rpg game with a fantastical setting, we follow the story of a devastated protagonist as he follows clues to take revenge on the enemies that destroyed his town. This game was developed for the course ICS 481: Video Game Design and uses the Unity game engine. I was one of the developers for the game and designed the top down rpg portion of the game. I worked with our team's writer to implement storytelling and game progression.
