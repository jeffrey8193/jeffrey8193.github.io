summary: "Designed a user interface to access database commands in ICS 212."
---

Using all the C and C++ skills I learned in ICS 212 I designed a user interface to access database commands and functionality. All the coding was done through the cloud and code was compiled and executed using the Unix terminal. The goal of this project was to show that we developed the necessary skills to be proficient in C and C++ and that we understood the fundamental computer instructions our code was describing. In order to finish this project, I used skills like code tracing to confirm that every line of my program works and that no errors like memory leaks were occurring. In addition external tools like Makefiles were used to streamline the development project and avoid accidental errors. This project is a solid indication of my proficiency in not only programming in C/C++ but also being able to understand what the program is doing in computer memory.
